# **About Me**

Hello I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
A game designer and UC Santa Cruz class of 2022. Over the years I've done work on a variety of games and projects, mainly in design and programming roles. <br>

As a previous Associate Designer at tabletop company, **2CGaming**, I did a bit of conceptual and system design for a tabletop to card game adaptation in addition to working on a visual novel prototype. I've also worked as a designer and programmer for an indie game called **Take As Needed**, which was funded by a research grant and released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1780110/Take_As_Needed/). <br>

While I've worked on an assortment of roles within game development, my main interest is in **mechanics** and **systems design**. I enjoy the process of setting a vision and iterating through new types of solutions. It requires both a mix of creative thinking and technical knowledge. Yet while the field is unqiue to games, I also find it interesting how ideas can come from all aspects of life and media.
