##### Overview
*Thief of Time* is a fast paced 2D action game focused on juggling enemies and manipulating time. The player has a variety of attacks which can be performed by holding the movement controls in different directions while pressing the light or heavy attack button. Additionally, the player can also freeze time to create interesting combos.

My role on the project was lead designer and lead programmer. I created and balanced the combat system and player controls, created design documents to convey feature ideas, ran playtests, and directed the team towards the game's general vision.
