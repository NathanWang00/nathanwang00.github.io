##### Production Details
+ 2D action game made in Unity
+ 3 weeks on top of other classwork
+ Designed for mobile devices and PC

##### My Goals
+ Test my concept to prototyping capabilities within limited timespan
+ Gain more experience in other disciplines
+ Design an easy to pickup control scheme

Insert picture of dodging iteration here, also maybe 1 Touch RPG

##### Summary
Overall, one of my favorite projects. Working within the time constraints was tough, but I enjoyed doing the design for the combat and controls.
Also, throughout the project, I learned that I sometimes focus too much on the mechanics and technical design. While my main focus was on the gameplay, I should have put my effort into creating a more cohesive aesthetic.
