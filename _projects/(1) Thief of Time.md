##### Overview
*Thief of Time* is a fast paced 2D game that puts a unique twist on combat mechanics by incorporating time manipulation. Players juggle enemies and use various attacks, each executed by holding different movement controls and pressing light or heavy attack buttons. Moreover, the game allows players to freeze time, creating an opportunity for creative combos and maneuvers.

As the lead designer and lead programmer on this project, I played a crucial role in shaping the game's overall vision and bringing it to life. I developed and balanced the combat system and player controls, creating design documents to convey feature ideas, and running playtests to refine the game's mechanics. I also directed the team to ensure that everyone was working towards the same goal and that the game's general vision was achieved.

This project was created as part of the UC Santa Cruz senior capstone series, where students had the opportunity to pitch their game ideas to professors and hundreds of other students. In order to gather teammates for the project, I recorded a video and created a prototype ahead of time to accurately convey the game's concept. This experience was challenging, but ultimately rewarding, as it allowed me to gain valuable pitching and communication skills.
