##### Overview
This project is a fanmade card game adaptation of the beloved game, *Plants vs Zombies*. In this two-player game, players battle by creating zombies on their opponent's lawn and defending their own with plants.

As a key contributor to this project, my main responsibility was developing the combat system and creating the rules. Additionally, I played a vital role in organizing the documentation, conducting playtests, and balancing cards.
