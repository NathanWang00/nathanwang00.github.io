##### Overview
This project is an fanmade card game adaptation of the popular game, *Plants vs Zombies*. In it, 2 players battle against each other by creating zombies on their opponent's lawn, while using plants to defend their own.

For this adaptation, my main role was developing the combat system, creating the rules, and organizing the documentation. I also worked together with other designers to run playtests and balance the cards.
