##### Overview
*Adventure Pack* is a concept design for a casual card game that challenges players to assemble the ultimate pack of equipment before their friends. The game is tailored for tabletop RPG enthusiasts and can even be used in D&D 5e campaigns to divide gear and rewards.

As a key contributor to this project, I worked closely with 2CGaming designer Celeste Conowitch to expand on her original concept and develop engaging gameplay systems and mechanics.
