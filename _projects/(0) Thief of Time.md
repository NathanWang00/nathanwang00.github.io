##### Production Details
+ 2D action platformer made in Unity
+ 10 weeks on top of other classwork
+ Group of 9 (1 Producer, 2 Designers/Progammers, 2 Programmers, 3 Aritsts, 1 Sound Designer)

##### My Goals
+ Design a fluid action game with an emphasis on player spectacle
+ Form a clear vision for the mechanics and communicate it to each member of the team
+ Create an intuitive control scheme
+ Iterate upon player feedback to create a balanced experience

##### Summary
For this project, I was the lead designer and programmer in a group of 9. Specifically, I created and balanced the combat system and controls, while also overseeing the project's direction.

This was my first experience of being in charge of a team of that scale. While I made a lot of mistakes, I learned a lot about working in teams and directing my groupmates towards a singular vision.

The project also ran into production issues, especially with the art, which forced me to cut the game down to it's core mechanics. While it didn't turn out to be everything I hoped for, I took many of the lessons I learned into future projects.
