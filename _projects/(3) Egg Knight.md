##### Production Details
+ *Genre:* 2D action
+ *Time Spent:* 50~ hours
+ *Platform:* Browser and Android
+ *Engine and Language:* Unity, C#

##### Overview
*Egg Knight* is a short and simple *Punch-Out!!!* and *Infinity Blade* inspired action game. The player has multiple offensive and defensive options which can be performed via touch controls or mouse. For example, if the player taps on an enemy they do a stabbing attack, while if they swipe their character they do a dodge. The game also features a few enemies with unique behaviours and timings.

For this game, I did everything from the input system, to the enemy designs, to the art and animations. The music, sound effects, and the audio implementation code which were obtained from various royalty free sources.

##### My Goals
+ Test my concept to prototyping capabilities within limited timespan
+ Gain more experience in other disciplines
+ Design an easy to pickup control scheme

Insert picture of dodging iteration here, also maybe 1 Touch RPG

##### Summary
Overall, one of my favorite projects. Working within the time constraints was tough, but I enjoyed doing the design for the combat and controls.
Also, throughout the project, I learned that I sometimes focus too much on the mechanics and technical design. While my main focus was on the gameplay, I should have put my effort into creating a more cohesive aesthetic.
