##### Production Details
+ 2D action game made using CrispGameLib and JavaScript
+ 1 week on top of other classwork

##### My Goals
+ Create an engaging action game using only one button
+ Easy to learn, hard to master

##### Summary
One of my smaller projects, but I liked the simplicity and cohesion within the design. Being forced to use a single input meant that I had to be more creative with the uses of each action. For example, using the knockback from shooting the rocks for movement and holding the rocks to both aim and block enemy shots.
