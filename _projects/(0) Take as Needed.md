##### Overview
*Take as Needed* is a near future puzzle and visual novel game. The player works as a scientist at a pharmaceutical company whose actions can influence the world around them. The game also explores themes of addiction, mental health, and stress. 
Additionally, the project was funded by a research grant where we looked into innovative and more appropriate ways into portraying mental health in video games.

In this project, I was a designer and programmer. My main role was developing the puzzle/drug mechanics. For example, creating the price and volatility system, designing the chemical connections, and programming the controls.
