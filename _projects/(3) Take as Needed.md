##### Overview
*Take as Needed* is a puzzle and visual novel game set in the near future that explores complex themes such as addiction, mental health, and stress. As a scientist at a pharmaceutical company, the player's decisions have far-reaching consequences in the world they inhabit. The game's development was funded by a research grant, allowing us to research and explore new ways of portraying mental health in video games.

As a designer and programmer, my key responsibility was to develop the drug creation mechanics. This included creating a dynamic pricing and volatility system, designing chemical connections, programming intuitive controls, and implementing the UI. The game was developed using Unity and written in C#.
