##### Production Details
+ *Genre:* Arcade action
+ *Time Spent:* 20~ hours
+ *Role:* Sole developer
+ *Platform:* Browser
+ *Engine and Language:* CrispGameLib, JavaScript

##### Overview
*Magnet Crush* is a one-button action arcade game about magnetizing and shooting debris. Since the only input is the mouse, every action has multiple uses. For instance, magnetizing debris acts as a shield against enemy shots and firing debris can also be used for movement. The game also has a score feature to allow for replayability.

As the sole developer for this project, I did the mechanics design, programming and the sprites myself. The code was primarily written in Javascript and used the game library, CrispGameLib.

##### My Goals
+ Create an engaging action game using only one button
+ Easy to learn, hard to master


##### Summary
One of my smaller projects, but I liked the simplicity and cohesion within the design. Being forced to use a single input meant that I had to be more creative with the uses of each action. For example, using the knockback from shooting the rocks for movement and holding the rocks to both aim and block enemy shots.
