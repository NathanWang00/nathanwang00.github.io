###### Arcade action

##### Production Details
+ Role: **Sole developer**
+ Tools: **CrispGameLib, JavaScript**
+ Team size: **1**
+ Platform: **Browser**

##### Overview
*Magnet Crush* is a one-button action arcade game that allows players to magnetize and shoot debris. With only the mouse as input, every action has multiple uses - magnetizing debris serves as a shield against enemy shots, while firing debris can be used for movement. The game also features a score system, encouraging replayability.

As the sole developer for this project, I did the mechanics design, programming and the sprites myself. The code was primarily written in Javascript and utilized the game library, CrispGameLib.

##### My Goals
+ Create an engaging action game using only one button
+ Easy to learn, hard to master


##### Summary
One of my smaller projects, but I liked the simplicity and cohesion within the design. Being forced to use a single input meant that I had to be more creative with the uses of each action. For example, using the knockback from shooting the rocks for movement and holding the rocks to both aim and block enemy shots.
