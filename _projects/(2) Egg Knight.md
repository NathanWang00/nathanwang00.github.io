# Egg Knight
###### 2D action

![gameplay](/assets/Capture.gif)

##### Production Details
+ Role: **Sole developer**
+ Tools: **Unity, C#**
+ Team size: **1**
+ Platform: **Browser and Android**


##### Overview
*Egg Knight* is a fast-paced action game that draws inspiration from *Punch-Out!!!* and *Infinity Blade*. With intuitive touch controls or mouse input, players can execute multiple offensive and defensive maneuvers, such as stabbing attacks and dodges. The game also features unique enemies with different behaviors and timings to keep players engaged.

As the sole developer on this project, I handled every aspect of the game's development, from the input system and enemy designs to the art and animations. While I obtained the music, sound effects, and audio implementation code from various royalty-free sources, I tried to ensure that they fit seamlessly into the game's overall aesthetic.

##### My Goals
+ Test my concept to prototyping capabilities within limited timespan
+ Gain more experience in other disciplines
+ Design an easy to pickup control scheme

Insert picture of dodging iteration here, also maybe 1 Touch RPG

##### Summary
Overall, one of my favorite projects. Working within the time constraints was tough, but I enjoyed doing the design for the combat and controls.
Also, throughout the project, I learned that I sometimes focus too much on the mechanics and technical design. While my main focus was on the gameplay, I should have put my effort into creating a more cohesive aesthetic.
