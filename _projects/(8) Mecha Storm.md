##### Overview
*Mecha Storm* is a challenging bullet hell game where players must strategically dodge waves of enemies while managing limited resources. Armed with a short-range sword and gun, players must use a unique power-up system to overcome increasingly difficult challenges, including a two-stage boss battle. 

As both lead designer and programmer, I was responsible for creating the game's resource systems, enemy wave layout, and player mechanics, as well as providing direction for the art team. Mecha Storm was programmed using Phaser, a JavaScript-based game framework designed for use in web browsers.
