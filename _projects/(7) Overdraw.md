##### Overview
*Overdraw* is a tap and shoot action game developed for mobile devices. The player uses a bow to defend against waves of different enemies, while trying to increase their score and combo meter.

For this project I was the sole developer, meaning that I did everything from combat, to enemy design, to UI and animation. *Overdraw* was one of the first games that I've made, and it was developed mainly within Construct 3.
